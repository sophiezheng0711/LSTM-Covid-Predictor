# LSTM-Covid-Predictor
COVID-19 has been arguably the biggest life-changer for our generation. It has made 2020 void of vacation, reunions, parties, gatherings, etc. Visiting the John Hopkins COVID website has become a daily routine, making us wonder: when will this disaster end?

Using existing data on COVID-19 in the United States (From January 2020 to November 2020), I decided to use machine learning to predict the number of cases of COVID-19 in the US. I am using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) RNN architecture. LSTMs are generally known for predicting the stock market prices and completing the given sentence, and are widely used in fields such as NLP. Due to the limited knowledge of the virus the current world possesses, no known model is able to accurately predict the number of cases of COVID-19. Therefore, this project only aims to predict a fairly accurate trend.
